# Running the Site Locally
First fork the repo or clone it then open it with your code editor --> in your terminal run the command â†’

             npm install     (itâ€™ll install the dependencies)

             node server.js     (itâ€™ll start running the appâ€™s server)

Note: you can use â†’ nodemon server.js (instead of â†’ node server.js) to run the server

install nodemon :

             npm install --g nodemon

We use nodemon so that we don't need to reconnect our server while making any change in node.js, it'll automatically reconnect our server (itâ€™ll save our time while developing ðŸ˜€)
Then, after running the backend server --> go to the http://localhost:3000 url --> the site will visually appear in your browser locally (in development mode).
